// Make a JavaScript file named liri.js

// At the top of the liri.js file make it so you grab the data from keys.js and store it into a variable to use

// Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following arguments

// my-tweets

// spotify-this-song

// movie-this

// do-what-it-says

// So if you succeed, running the following commands in your terminal will do the followig things

// node liri.js my-tweets
// will show your last 20 tweets and when they were created at in the terminal
// node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
// shows the following information about the song in the terminal

// artist(s)
// song name
// preview link of the song from spotify
// album that the song is a part of
// song name
// if no song is provided then your program will default to

// "what's my age again" by blink 182
// node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
// this would output the following information to the terminal:

// Title
// Year
// IMDB Rating
// Country
// Language
// Plot
// Actors
// Rotten Tomatoes Rating
// Rotton Tomatoes UrL

// if no movie is provided then the program will output information for the movie: 'Mr. Nobody'

// if you haven't watched Mr. Nobody then you should: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/
// You can catch it on Netflix
// node liri.js do-what-it-says 
// Using the fs package in node, the program would take the text inside of random.txt and use it to call the first command with the second part as it's parameter

// Currently in random.txt, the following text is there:

// spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way"
// so according to those instructions, you would call the appropriate function and pass in "I Want it That Way" as the song.

// This should work for any function and paramter you use.

// To get the data for the above things you'll have to use the following npm packages:

// twitter
// spotify
// request

// The request npm package will be used to hit the OMDB API
// OMDB API
// to install these npm packages run these commands one at a time.

// npm install twitter
// npm install spotify
// npm install request
// BONUS
// In addition to outputting the data to the terminal, also output all data to a txt file called log.txt

// Make sure that each command you run gets appended to the log.txt file.

// Your log.txt file should not be overwritten each time you run a command.
